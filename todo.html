projects I'll be working on soon:

youtube playlist maker
-insert youtube videos, it appends them 
to your group's website

IOU website
-smallest scope
-time for polish
-'fintech' product that deals with money is attractive realm.
-product is simple.

Find Project Collaborators
-appeals to coders (looking at resume)
-cool thing that could really gain traction
-Scope is probably feasible.
-product is not very complex.

Live Code Challenge
-appeals to coders
-live, sockets.
-multiple game modes (shortest text, shortest time, lowest time complexity, combo of all)
-scopable, mvp is not incredibly complex (user accounts not necessary,etc.)
-lots of room for expansion
-not too many client views to design

Restaurant Bill Splitter
-relatively simple idea, needs amazing UX though
-more like a real world product, but won't have a real world client
--but maybe could be marketed to someone afterwards?
-kind of more ideal for tablets, might be designing it for mobile...
